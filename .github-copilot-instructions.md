This is a support website to help my friend Kelly create their own websites using VSCode and GitHub Copilot. The project includes:

## Project Structure
- **Welcome Page and mind map**: "Do you need a bunch of money and coding experience to build a website? Fuck No! You can AI do it and then take all the credit without it coming back for vengence, maybe.....". 
    -Mindmap with D3.js to create an interactive, expandable node experience. Preset maps, 1 is "endless possibilities with coding", 2 is a map of front end, back end, VSCode, Supabase etc. When a node is clicked it expands with more details. 
- **Jump in**: Step-by-step setup instructions for getting started. Download VSCode, create a folder(not in icloud), open folder in VSCode, click on copilot, select agent mode and use claude 4 or highest version available, paste your prompt and let it get to work.
- **Website Map**: Interactive explanation of visual website components, their names and descriptions.
- **Prompting Tools**: Creative survey to find out her project details and goals which generates a prompt for her to paste into copilot. minimize how much she has to type by offering lots of preset options.
